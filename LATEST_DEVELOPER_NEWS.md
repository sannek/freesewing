##### Updated developer documentation

We've give [freesewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/), our websites for
developers, a bit of a face-lift to bring it in line with recent changes
on [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org/), our website for makers.

If you find anything lacking or broken, please don't hesitate
to [create an issue](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues/new).

##### Contributor calls

Recently, we started organizing contributor calls. 
Anybody with an interest in FreeSewing is welcome to join.

All calls can be joined via [meet.freesewing.org](https://meet.freesewing.org/). 
Notes and todos are [available on Github](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afscc).

##### We’ve moved to Discord

We’ve moved our chat rooms from to Discord. 
Our legacy chat on Gitter is deprecated.

You can join us at https://chat.freesewing.org,
